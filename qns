Lab cycle 1

1. Develop a program to read a paragraph of text and perform the 
following tasks: a. Count the total number of words. b. Calculate the 
average word length. c. Identify and print the longest word. d. Replace 
all occurrences of a specific word with another word of your choice.

2. String Encryption Write a program that reads a sentence from the user 
and encrypts it using a simple Caesar cipher. The user can specify the 
shift value. Implement the encryption such that only alphabetic 
characters are shifted, while maintaining their case.

3. Data Validation and User Input Develop a program to read student 
records with their names, ages, and grades. Implement validation 
checks: a. Ensure age is a positive integer. b. Ensure grade is a valid 
letter grade (A, B, C, D, F). c. Calculate and display the average age 
of students with valid records.

4. Password Generator Write a program to generate a random password 
for a user. The password should include a mix of uppercase letters, 
lowercase letters, digits, and special characters. Allow the user to 
specify the length of the password.

5. Series Summation Develop a program to calculate the sum of the 
series: 1 - 2/3 + 3/5 - 4/7 + ... up to a specified number of terms. Allow 
the user to input the number of terms in the series.

6.Prime Number Checker Write a program to check whether a given 
number is prime or not. Implement this using both loops and functions. 
Additionally, allow the user to input a range and identify all prime 
numbers within that range.

7. Fibonacci Series with a Twist Develop a program to generate the 
Fibonacci series, but with a twist. Allow the user to input the number of 
terms and generate the series where each term is the sum of the last 
three terms.

8. Palindrome Checker Write a program that reads a string and checks if 
it's a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards 
and backwards, ignoring spaces and punctuation.

9. Data Compression Design a program to read a string and compress it 
using run-length encoding. In run-length encoding, consecutive 
repeated characters are replaced with a single character followed by 
the count of occurrences.

10. Data Reversal Write a program to reverse the order of elements 
in a given list. Implement this without using any built-in functions or 
loops


Lab cycle - 2

1. Create a scatterplot of the Sepal.Length and Petal.Length variables in 
the iris dataset using the plot function? Add appropriate labels and title 
to the plot. Save the plot as a high-resolution image file.

2. Create a scatterplot of the mpg and disp variables in the mtcars
dataset. Use different colors to represent the cyl variable and add a 
smooth line to show the trend. Add appropriate labels, title, and legend 
to the plot

3. Create a bar plot of the number of cylinders (cyl) in the mtcars dataset. 
Use different colors to represent the transmission type (am). Add 
appropriate title, labels, and legend to the plot.

4. Create a histogram of the miles per gallon (mpg) in the mtcars dataset. 
Use different shades of blue to represent the frequency of each bin. 
Add appropriate title and labels to the plot. Calculate and display the 
mean and standard deviation of mpg on the plot.

5. Create a box plot of the horsepower (hp) in the mtcars dataset. Use 
different shapes to represent the number of gears (gear). Add 
appropriate title, labels, and legend to the plot. Identify and label any 
outliers on the plot.

6. Create a scatter plot of the displacement (disp) versus the weight (wt) 
in the mtcars dataset. Use different colors and sizes to represent the 
number of carburetors (carb). Add appropriate title, labels, and legend 
to the plot. Add a smooth line to show the trend of the relationship.

7. Develop an R program to create a time series plot using real-world 
data. (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/niketchauhan/covid-19-timeseries-data)

8. Perform EDA on "Titanic Dataset". You are given the Titanic dataset, 
which contains information about passengers on the Titanic, including 
their survival status, age, class, and gender. 
a)plot the histogram of 
Number of parents and children of the passenger aboard(parch).
b)Perform a detailed EDA, including advanced statistical analysis, to 
explore factors influencing survival rates. 
c)Create a customized box plot to visualize the age distribution of 
survivors and non-survivors.

9. EDA on "Iris Dataset"
a) For the Iris dataset, which contains measurements of various iris 
flowers, conduct an EDA.
a. Determine if there are statistically significant differences in sepal 
lengths between different species using a suitable statistical test.
b. Create a pair plot to visualize the relationships between all variables.
